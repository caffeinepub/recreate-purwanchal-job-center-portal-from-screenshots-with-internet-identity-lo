  "summary": "Implemented a session-stored password gate for the admin UI, added hooks to store/administer the password, wired admin React Query mutations to pass the session password, and introduced an admin-only name-based recipient search in Messages via a new authorized user search query. Social/tel link updates appear to be implemented in Landing/Dashboard per file summaries, but the backend password validation and logo asset addition are not clearly evidenced in the diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add/replace the logo file at frontend/public/assets/logo-job.jpg so it is included in the deployed build and keep existing /assets/logo-job.jpg usages working.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any added or modified static asset at frontend/public/assets/logo-job.jpg (only TS/TSX files are shown as added). Without that file change, the requirement to ensure the logo exists in the deployed build is not evidenced.",

      "requirement": "Backend must validate admin password exactly equals \"@rewan10\" and reject (trap) otherwise for create/update/delete job vacancies and posts.",
      "reason": "The backend diff excerpt only clearly shows a new authorizedUserSearch query and does not provide evidence that createJobVacancy/updateJobVacancy/deleteJobVacancy and createPost/updatePost/deletePost were updated or had password-guarded variants added, nor that they validate the password \"@rewan10\".",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes an admin-password-authorized query returning principals + user names, with optional case-insensitive contains filtering by name, and traps on invalid password.",
      "reason": "Although backend/main.mo shows the start of an authorizedUserSearch method, the diff is truncated before confirming (1) exact password check consistent with the new model, and (2) full case-insensitive contains filtering logic across first/last/full name.",
